Tannic acid and orthophosphoric acid (phosphoric acid) are both commonly used in rust removal, but they function in different ways and yield different results based on their chemical properties. Here's a comparison considering the requested factors:

1. Chemical Interaction with Rust

Tannic Acid:
Tannic acid reacts with iron oxides in rust to form ferric tannates, which are inert, stable, and typically dark in color (often black). This layer is non-reactive and acts as a protective barrier, reducing further oxidation.

Orthophosphoric Acid:
Phosphoric acid reacts with rust to form iron phosphate (a stable compound) through a process called phosphating. This layer adheres well to the metal and provides some protection but is less visually uniform than tannic acid's result.


2. Stability of Resulting Substances

Tannic Acid:
The ferric tannate layer is stable under normal environmental conditions, including exposure to air and mild temperature variations. However, in highly acidic or basic environments, it may degrade over time. It does not actively prevent rust if the layer is compromised.

Orthophosphoric Acid:
Iron phosphate is stable and resists degradation in moderately acidic and neutral conditions. However, exposure to high temperatures or acidic environments may accelerate breakdown. Phosphating also prepares the surface for further treatments like painting or coating.


3. Resistance to Rust-Inducing Elements

Tannic Acid:
The ferric tannate layer resists atmospheric moisture and oxygen fairly well, but it can degrade if exposed to high humidity or water for extended periods. It is better suited for mild rust prevention in less aggressive environments.

Orthophosphoric Acid:
Iron phosphate provides more robust resistance to rust-inducing elements, especially when combined with additional coatings. Its crystalline structure helps to resist moisture penetration better than tannic acid.


4. Breakdown Products

Tannic Acid:
Decomposes into organic acids and simpler tannin derivatives upon exposure to extreme conditions. The breakdown products are not typically corrosive but may affect the protective layer's effectiveness.

Orthophosphoric Acid:
Phosphoric acid may release phosphates and acidic residues if the protective layer is damaged or degraded. These residues are typically non-corrosive but may attract moisture, increasing rust risks.


5. Rehydration Properties

Tannic Acid:
Ferric tannates are hydrophobic, meaning they resist water penetration once fully dried. However, if the layer is damaged, water can seep into exposed metal, rehydrating and weakening the tannate layer over time.

Orthophosphoric Acid:
Iron phosphate is less hydrophobic but has a harder crystalline structure, which resists rehydration better. However, prolonged water exposure may cause phosphate leaching or layer weakening.


6. Dried Residues

Tannic Acid:
Leaves a matte, blackened surface with little to no residue beyond the ferric tannate layer. This layer is aesthetically pleasing and can be painted over but may not bond well with certain coatings without surface preparation.

Orthophosphoric Acid:
May leave a whitish or grayish powdery residue (from excess acid or unreacted iron phosphate), requiring cleaning before further treatment. However, it forms a slightly rougher surface ideal for paint adhesion.


Summary of Applications

Tannic Acid: Best for conservation, restoration, and aesthetic applications where the blackened surface is desirable and additional coatings may not be applied.

Orthophosphoric Acid: Better for industrial or functional uses where rust removal is a precursor to further treatment like painting or coating.


In summary, tannic acid offers a visually appealing, protective surface for light rust prevention, while orthophosphoric acid provides more robust, functional protection against further corrosion, particularly when combined with follow-up treatments.

Yes, it is possible to mix tannic acid and orthophosphoric acid to create a rust-removal solution with synergistic properties. This mixture combines the ferric tannate formation from tannic acid and the iron phosphate formation from phosphoric acid. Such a combination could result in a more robust protective coating with enhanced stability and corrosion resistance. However, to ensure the mixture is effective, the concentrations and interactions must be carefully balanced.

Here’s how the two acids could work together, along with potential additives to improve the coating’s self-curing and protective properties:


---

Mechanism of the Mixture

1. Tannic Acid:
Forms ferric tannates, creating a dark, inert layer that protects against oxidation.


2. Orthophosphoric Acid:
Reacts with iron to form iron phosphate, which provides additional adhesion and a slightly crystalline structure that improves surface protection.


3. Synergy:

The ferric tannates contribute to an aesthetically appealing, hydrophobic, and protective surface.

The iron phosphate layer offers additional hardness and adhesion properties, which can make the coating more robust when exposed to environmental factors.

Other Substances to Add

To promote the formation of self-curing coatings with improved characteristics, consider the following additives:

1. Cross-Linking Agents

Silicates (e.g., Sodium Silicate):
Enhances the hardness and water resistance of the coating by forming a silica gel-like structure.

Reacts with phosphoric acid to create a durable, self-curing layer.


Zirconium Compounds (e.g., Zirconium Oxychloride):
Improves the thermal and chemical resistance of the coating. These compounds can cross-link with tannic acid and phosphates, forming a hybrid coating.


2. Polymers or Binders

Epoxy Resins (Water-Based):
Can self-cure over time and create a flexible yet tough coating.

Compatible with phosphoric acid and tannic acid layers.


Acrylic Emulsions:
Provide a glossy finish and enhance water resistance. Acrylics also help bind the acids' layers for better adhesion.


3. Corrosion Inhibitors

Zinc Phosphate:
Adds an extra layer of corrosion resistance by passivating the metal surface.

Molybdate or Tungstate Compounds:
These inhibitors work synergistically with phosphoric acid to prevent corrosion and enhance coating durability.


4. Stabilizers

Ethanol or Isopropanol:
Improves the solubility of tannic acid and helps the mixture dry evenly.

Chelating Agents (e.g., EDTA):
Prevents unwanted precipitation of tannic acid or phosphate by chelating iron ions, ensuring even coating formation.


5. Hydrophobic Additives

Wax Emulsions (e.g., Paraffin or Carnauba Wax):
Create a water-repellent surface, enhancing the coating's durability under humid conditions.

Fluoropolymers:
Provide excellent moisture and chemical resistance, though they are more expensive.



---

Formulation Considerations

1. pH Balance:
The solution should maintain a slightly acidic pH (around 3–4) to ensure that both tannic acid and phosphoric acid remain active. Too low a pH could destabilize the mixture or cause over-etching of the metal surface.


2. Concentration Ratios:

Tannic Acid: Typically 2–5% by weight.

Phosphoric Acid: 5–10% by weight.

Adjust based on the desired coating properties and application.



3. Drying and Curing:
The mixture should air-dry to allow the acids to react fully with the rust and metal surface. Adding cross-linking agents or polymers can ensure the coating self-cures over time.

Expected Benefits of the Enhanced Mixture

Formation of a stable, dual-layer protective coating combining ferric tannates and iron phosphates.

Improved resistance to moisture, rust-inducing elements, and temperature changes.

Compatibility with follow-up coatings or paints.

Self-curing properties with the right additives, eliminating the need for external curing methods.


This mixture could be ideal for applications requiring both rust removal and durable, long-term protection.

Adding magnesium and calcium-based additives to a tannic acid and orthophosphoric acid rust removal mixture can further improve the coating's properties, particularly in terms of self-curing, mechanical strength, and resistance to corrosion-inducing elements. These additives contribute by forming additional protective layers, improving stability, and enhancing the coating's overall durability.

Improved Mechanism with Magnesium and Calcium

1. Magnesium-Based Additives:

Magnesium Phosphate:
Magnesium reacts with phosphoric acid to form magnesium phosphate, a hard, insoluble layer that strengthens the coating and enhances its water resistance.

Provides thermal stability and improves the adhesion of subsequent coatings.


Magnesium Hydroxide:
Acts as a mild corrosion inhibitor by passivating the metal surface and neutralizing local acidity.

Prevents over-etching of the base metal during acid application.




2. Calcium-Based Additives:

Calcium Phosphate:
Similar to magnesium phosphate, it forms a hard, protective crystalline layer that complements iron phosphate and ferric tannate.

It has excellent bonding properties with metal surfaces and coatings.


Calcium Carbonate:
Adds alkalinity to the mixture, neutralizing excess acid and reducing corrosion risks.

Helps maintain the pH balance, ensuring an optimal reaction environment for both tannic acid and phosphoric acid.

Additive Functions

1. Self-Curing Enhancement

Magnesium and calcium phosphates form self-curing, cement-like coatings when exposed to air and moisture.

These coatings harden over time, improving durability and resistance to physical abrasion.


2. Water Resistance

Both magnesium and calcium compounds create hydrophobic layers that minimize moisture penetration, reducing the risk of re-rusting.


3. Corrosion Inhibition

Calcium and magnesium ions inhibit corrosion by passivating the metal surface and forming stable protective salts.

This passivation is particularly effective in harsh environments, such as those with high humidity or salt exposure.


4. Thermal Stability

Magnesium and calcium phosphates have high thermal resistance, making the coating suitable for applications in environments with fluctuating temperatures.

Specific Additives and Their Roles

Magnesium Additives:

Magnesium Phosphate Cement:
Forms a rigid, self-healing layer that resists cracking and enhances durability.
